**Submission for AsiaCCS 2026**

This repository contains the source code, dataset, and reproduction scripts for the poster: **"A Structured Framework for the Reproducible Evaluation of Privacy and Anonymity."**

## 1. The Framework
Our framework explicitly models privacy evaluations across five dimensions to prevent "apples-to-oranges" comparisons.
